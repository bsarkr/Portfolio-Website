# Personal Portfolio

By Bilash Sarkar  

This is my personal developer portfolio, designed to showcase my projects, skills, and experience in a clean and modern way.  
The design is inspired by Apple’s minimalistic UI style — smooth gradients, bold typography, and subtle animations that highlight content without distraction.  

The goal of this portfolio is to present my work professionally while still reflecting my design preferences:
- Providing a central hub for my resume, projects, and skills.
- Keeping the UI sleek, responsive, and mobile-friendly.
- Using smooth scrolling and transitions for a premium feel.
- Hosting on AWS with a custom domain for scalability and reliability.

## Technologies Used
- React + Vite – Fast and modern frontend development.
- Tailwind CSS – Utility-first styling with a polished, minimal aesthetic.
- AWS S3 + CloudFront – Hosting and global distribution.
- GitHub Actions – Automated deployment on commits.
- Git & GitHub – Version control and repository management.

This project taught me the importance of design consistency, scalability, and automation.  
It’s not just a website — it’s a professional representation of who I am as a developer, with the same attention to detail I bring into every project.

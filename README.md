# Personal Portfolio – React + Vite

This is my **personal developer portfolio**, designed to showcase my projects, skills, and experience in a clean, modern, and visually engaging way.  
The design is heavily inspired by **Apple’s minimalistic UI style** – smooth gradients, polished typography, and a focus on simplicity that lets the content speak for itself.  
It’s built with **React + Vite** for blazing-fast performance, and deployed on **AWS** for scalability and reliability.

Currently, this website is not yet hosted. However, once this website is operational, I will be hosting it was AWS
